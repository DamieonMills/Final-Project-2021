      <p>Hey everybody, this is Damieon here. This is my first post about my channel.</p>

      <p>My username is DJTHEKING14. Occasionally, I spend some of my days playing video games among multiple platforms and systems. This channel just like others is a gaming channel. I create and edit playthrough videos along with commentary from yours truley. </p>

      <p>As of right now, I am a beginner when it comes to creating videos. I am continously learning new editing techniques to create better content. To this day, I have a few subscribers. I am not expecting much on the page for the moment as I know
      that I am not as popular as the current day channels (yet).</p>

      <p>For the content that I create, I would normally play story based video games. Such examples are like the Devil May Cry franchise, Catherine, Mortal Kombat, and more
      to come.</p>

      <p>Right now, I just need to continue to work harder and make more videos. Who knows, I may add something new to the channel someday. Until then, go on ahead and click on My YouTube while you're here.</p>
